Issues
----------------------------------
- Plugins system is a bit messy
	- Actions, and operators can get messy
- Better heuristic opposed to most used?
- Passing arguments works but it is hack around live queries 
	- well this isn't a command line anyway so maybe okay
- Plugins can halt the show
- don't reload everything for small updates to data
- More customization
- more user friendly

- the extension interface is a bit messy
	- but it works very well
- Add a better heuristic instead of frequently used ... or maybe it is fine
	* should work in all cases not just when < 10

- passing arguments works but it is hack around the api involving live queries
	- it is not bad and should be discouraged this is not a command line ?


- the / also limits the arguments to operators eg. for paths

- dont crash with malformed extensions
	- processes should not freeze main gui

- SPEED
	- regression in later version after icons
	- the re creating of stuff in the view is slow
    - note that the furthure the words you type you just remove items from the list that was there bc the search is refined... so repopulating is unecessary

- Add colors themeing, ...
- refinement

- think about api mechanism and if command line is needed
	- what if want to run  a command then what
	- it is called dispatch so I think it should support that
	- eg. systemctl suspend
	- think of it like intents, them typing more after is = putExtra
	- ARGUMENTS SHOULD BE BUILT IN

- maybe more functionality should be built in

- should seperate operator outputs to make it a bit cleaner to understand

- NOTE
	- since trie uses ordered set we get closest match at top

GOAL
- minimal + fast (could be better but yes)
- out of your way (could be better but yes)
	- not distracting from content

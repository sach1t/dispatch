- the extension interface is a bit messy
	- but it works very well
- Add a better heuristic instead of frequently used ... or maybe it is fine
- passing arguments works but it is hack around the api involving live queries
	- it is not bad and should be discouraged this is not a command line ?
- the searching could be a bit better allow words in middle
	- trie is selling point so dont change that 
- the / also limits the arguments to operators eg. for paths
- dont crash with malformed extensions
- stay fast get faster 
	- regression in later version after icons
	- the re creating of stuff in the view is slow
- Add colors themeing, ...
